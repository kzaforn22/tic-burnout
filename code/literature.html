  <h2>Literature Review (Ivy-style synthesis)</h2>

  <p>
    The literature converges on a consistent pattern: when professionals work in environments characterized by repeated exposure
    to trauma and chronic job demands, burnout risk increases—especially emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.
    Trauma-informed care (TIC) enters as a systems-level framework that targets organizational climate, shared language, and psychological safety.

  <h3>Theme 1: Secondary traumatic stress and compassion fatigue</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Professionals working with traumatized populations may develop secondary traumatic stress (STS), which can intensify burnout risk.</li>
    <li>Foundational work on compassion fatigue provides the conceptual base for organizational prevention strategies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Theme 2: Burnout as an occupational health outcome</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Burnout is commonly conceptualized across emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment.</li>
    <li>Occupational health psychology emphasizes aligning interventions with organizational demands, support structures, and leadership behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Theme 3: TIC as an organizational intervention</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>TIC models emphasize safety, trustworthiness, empowerment, collaboration, and cultural responsiveness.</li>
    <li>In juvenile justice staff populations, perceived TIC has been empirically linked with burnout and turnover intentions.</li>
    <li>Qualitative work in correctional environments highlights implementation realities—training must be reinforced through supervision and climate.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Consulting move:</strong> TIC is strongest when treated as a change-management program (training + coaching + policy alignment),
    not a one-time workshop.
