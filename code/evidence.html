  <h2>Evidence Snapshot (Contextual Data)</h2>
  <p>
    Because this capstone did not collect primary data, the evidence snapshot anchors the problem using
    publicly available corrections workforce datasets and peer-reviewed studies on stress, trauma exposure, and burnout.
    These sources help leadership understand baseline risk patterns and define what outcomes an intervention like TIC should target.

      <h3>Public datasets you can cite</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ICPSR 37329</strong>: Effects of Stress Among Correctional Officers, U.S., 2017–2018.</li>
        <li><strong>ICPSR 38442</strong>: Defining Impact of Stress and Traumatic Events on Corrections Officers, Oregon, 2018–2020.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        These datasets support descriptive and correlational analyses (e.g., stress exposure, organizational outcomes, well-being indicators).
        They do not directly test TIC training in juvenile justice, but they strengthen the rationale and measurement strategy.

      <h3>Peer-reviewed anchors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Jail officer PTSD and burnout research highlights the high burden of trauma exposure in correctional workforces.</li>
        <li>Juvenile justice staff perceptions of TIC have been linked to burnout and turnover intentions.</li>

    Burnout can be reframed as a measurable operational risk (retention, overtime, safety climate, and service disruptions).

  <h3>What we can responsibly claim from existing evidence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Corrections and justice professionals face elevated occupational stress and trauma exposure.</li>
    <li>Stress and trauma exposure are associated with negative well-being and organizational outcomes.</li>
    <li>In juvenile justice settings, perceptions of TIC are associated with burnout and turnover intentions.</li>
  </ul>

    This microsite avoids reporting “made-up” prevalence rates. If you later want a true quantitative snapshot,
    we can run a real analysis after you obtain the dataset files and confirm variable definitions.
