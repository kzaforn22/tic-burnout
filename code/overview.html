  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Juvenile justice professionals operate in high-demand environments where chronic exposure to youth trauma, crisis events,
    and organizational strain can increase risk for burnout. This project presents an evidence-informed proposal that frames
    trauma-informed care (TIC) training as a system-level intervention to protect staff well-being and improve organizational performance.
