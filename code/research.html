  <h2>Research Questions & Hypotheses</h2>
  <p><strong>Primary question:</strong> Can participation in trauma-informed care (TIC) training reduce burnout among juvenile justice professionals?</p>
  <p><strong>Secondary question:</strong> How might TIC function as an organizational protective factor against secondary traumatic stress?</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Hypothesis (proposed):</strong> Professionals who have completed TIC training will report lower burnout (emotional exhaustion & depersonalization)
    and higher personal accomplishment compared to professionals without training, measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) subscales.
  </div>

  <h3>Why this question matters</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Workforce sustainability:</strong> burnout is linked to turnover intentions and reduced morale.</li>
    <li><strong>Service quality:</strong> staff well-being shapes the consistency and relational climate youth experience.</li>
    <li><strong>System-level leverage:</strong> TIC is designed to change organizational practice, not just individual coping.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small">
    Note: The MBI is proprietary; a real-world implementation should use it via authorized access or use validated open instruments where appropriate.
