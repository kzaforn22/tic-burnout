  <h2>Limitations & Future Research</h2>

  <h3>Limitations of the capstone proposal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No primary data were collected; results are hypothetical and presented transparently as such.</li>
    <li>Quasi-experimental grouping introduces selection bias (who gets trained may differ systematically).</li>
    <li>Regional scope limits generalizability without multi-site replication.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Future research (Ivy-standard next steps)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Longitudinal tracking (burnout and retention over time).</li>
    <li>Randomized or stepped-wedge training rollouts where feasible.</li>
    <li>Test mediation: does psychological safety/supervision explain the effect of TIC on burnout?</li>
    <li>Cross-sector replication (healthcare, education, child welfare).</li>
  </ul>

    the next step is acquiring dataset files and running reproducible analyses.
