  <h2>Proposed Methods</h2>

  <p><strong>Design:</strong> Quasi-experimental, between-group comparison (existing TIC-trained vs. not trained).</p>
  <p><strong>Population:</strong> Juvenile justice professionals (e.g., probation, case managers, residential staff).</p>
  <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Youth detention/residential centers (capstone context originally near Gillette, Wyoming).</p>

  <h3>Variables & Measurement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Independent variable:</strong> TIC training completion (yes/no; training dose can be added later).</li>
    <li><strong>Dependent variable:</strong> Burnout (MBI subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment).</li>
    <li><strong>Covariates (recommended upgrades):</strong> tenure, role, shift, caseload intensity, critical incident exposure, supervision quality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Analysis plan</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Two-tailed independent samples t-tests for between-group differences.</li>
    <li>Assumption checks: normality and homogeneity of variance.</li>
    <li><em>Recommended Ivy upgrade:</em> report effect sizes and confidence intervals; consider regression adjustment with covariates.</li>
  </ul>
